## Procedural programming

### Java
#### Does Java support Procedural programming?
**No**. Java is a pure Object-Oriented programming, where all computations are carried out using object, which is component of a program that knows how to perform certain actions and how to interact with other elements of the program. Method and variable have to reside in Class. Procedures and data are all bundling into Object in OOP.

A simple print statement shows below:
```Java
System.out.println("Hello World");
```
This only works in a class.

### Swift
#### Does Swift support Procedural programming?
**No**. Swift is also an Object-Oriented programming. It does have some other features that differ from Java. However, The fundamental component of Object-Oriented concept is still kept in Swift language.

A simple print statement shows below:
``` Swift
print("Hello World")
```
This also can only be allowed within a class, a struct, or a enum.
